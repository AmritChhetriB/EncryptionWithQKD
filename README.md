# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol : Capstone Project 2023
		## Author: Amrit Chhetri, Quantum Computing Consultant

## Overview
This repository contains codes of QKD implementation uusing Python and Qiskit in a Jupyter Notebook environment. 
It is developed during a Introduciotn to Quantum Computing course offered by QxQ Coding School in Google Quantum, 
this project demonstrates the practical applications of QKD in secure communication. Quantum key distribution (QKD), is closely related to quantum cryptography, 
is a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of
quantum mechanics.


## Features
	### **Simulated QKD Environment**		: Simulation of QKD(quantum key distribution) process.
	### **Secure Message Transmission**		: After the successful distribution of a secure key, the implementation optionally supports sending encrypted messages using the established key.
	### **Jupyer Notebook Format**		: Easy to configure and run IDE environement for beginnerr as well as expert
## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have installtion of Python, Qiskit and Jupyter Labs or Jupyter Notebook

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.5 or higher
- Qiskit 1.0.2
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmritChhetriB/EncryptionWithQKD.git
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install qiskit jupyterlab
```

### Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook ('EncryptionWithQKD.ipynb') in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, check the environemnt and run
code to get started with .
